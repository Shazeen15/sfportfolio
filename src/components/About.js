      <h1>How did I get started with coding?</h1>
      <p>
        I graduated with a Masters Degree in Clinical Mental Health Counseling
        in May 2020. Although this was a great accomplishment, I did not feel
        fulfilled with my Master's degree. Suddenly, I asked myself if I wanted
        to do this for the rest of my life. I did not feel comfortable with the
        answer, or I did not know how to answer it.

        For a while, I felt stuck because I didn't feel like I had many options.
        I did not want to go back to school and do another four-plus year in
        school and add to my school debt. For a month or so, I was like a
        zombie, waking up and spend the whole day wondering what am I going to
        do. There has to be another way. Every day, I would wake up and dread
        about my step. At some point, I had to decide if I would continue to
        pursue a career in Mental Health or be stuck doing nothing. These were
        my options, at least to me at the time, and doing nothing was not an
        option. So, in reality, it was pursuing a career in the Mental Health
        field and be unhappy, and that is it.

        So how did I find coding or how coding found me. As everyone who is lost
        and have nothing to do, we go and get even more lost on YouTube.
        Continuously clicking and clicking on videos and barely paying
        attention, I landed on a YouTuber programming on Python. At the time, I
        didn't know what Python was, but I remember suddenly sitting up and
        being amazed at what she was doing. She created a program that would
        make a playlist on her Spotify based on her saved playlist on her
        YouTube. Watching that felt amazing to me, and I remember saying aloud
        that I want to learn how to do that. From that moment, I went to look
        online for courses and never looked back.
